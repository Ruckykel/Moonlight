        },
        {
          question: 'Why do I need to certify my account?',

        },
        {
          question: 'How long does the certification process take?',
          answer: 'Verification may take some time as we confirm your credentials, but once approved, you can start uploading movies immediately.'

        },
        {
          question: 'Can I upload movies that are premiering in cinemas?',
          answer: 'Yes! Producers can upload movies that are also premiering in cinemas and set a price for users to pay and watch.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I set a price for my cinema-premiering movie?',
          answer: 'When uploading a cinema-premiering movie, you\'ll have an option to set a price. Users must pay this amount to watch your movie on the platform.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will I still earn from watch hours if my movie is pay-to-watch?',

          answer: 'We track the total number of users who complete watching your movie. For standard uploads, this determines leaderboard ranking and earnings. For cinema-premiering movies, revenue is based on the number of users who pay to watch.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Does the leaderboard reset?',
          answer: 'Yes, the leaderboard resets every month to allow fresh competition among producers.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can the same user watching my movie multiple times increase my ranking?',
          answer: 'No, repeat views by the same user do not count. Only new unique users contribute to your total watch hours.'

          answer: 'Producers earn a share of the monthly subscription revenue based on their total watch hours.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I earn from a movie that is premiering in cinemas?',
          answer: 'You earn directly from user payments. The more users pay to watch your movie, the more revenue you generate.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I upload both free and pay-to-watch movies?',
          answer: 'Yes! You can upload standard movies that earn through watch hours and premium movies that require users to pay before watching.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What if my movie gets fewer watch hours?',
          answer: 'Earnings are directly linked to engagement. To maximize revenue, market your movie to attract more viewers.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need to set my own movie price?',
          answer: 'No, earnings come from a shared subscription pool, so you don\'t need to price your movie separately.'
